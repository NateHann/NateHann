# 👋 Hey there, I'm Nate Hann!

## About Me 🚀

- **Curious Techie:** I’m deeply passionate about all things **tech**, from web development to software engineering. I thrive on learning and enjoy experimenting with new technologies in my spare time.
- **Career & Studies:** I’ve recently completed my studies in **Full Stack Web Development** and **Software Engineering**. While balancing work and academics was challenging, it’s been one of the most rewarding chapters of my life.
- **Currently Employed:** I’m now working in the tech industry, putting my skills to use professionally. It’s a fulfilling role, and I’m excited about the journey ahead.

## GitHub Profile Status ⚙️

- I’m **in the process** of:
  - Updating, renaming, and refactoring past projects  
  - Organizing a range of code written during my studies  
  - Adding new work from personal, academic, and client-based projects

- That said, **updating this profile isn't a top priority right now** since I’m already employed. But rest assured—slowly and surely, I’ll be showcasing a fuller repertoire of:
  - Projects completed during my studies  
  - Projects from my consulting work  
  - Personal builds I’ve created just for fun  

## Let’s Connect 🤝

- Got a question, idea, or just want to connect?  
  **[Inbox me on GitHub](https://github.com/NateHann)** — I’m always happy to chat.

## Stay Tuned! 📌

- This README (like my journey) is **a work in progress**. As time allows, I’ll be sharing more of what I’ve built and what I’m building next.
